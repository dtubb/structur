# Example File with Unified Code Format

This is an example file showing how to use the unified code format in structur.py.

## Multiline Code Format

{{workflow}}==This is about how I organize my daily tasks and processes. I use a combination of time blocking and priority lists to stay productive.

The key is to batch similar tasks together and review regularly.=={{workflow}}

{{productivity}}==The key to productivity is not doing more things, but doing the right things. Focus on high-impact activities that move you toward your goals.

I've discovered that the 2-minute rule works well: if something takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately rather than adding it to a list.=={{productivity}}

## Single Line Code Format

{{writing}}==I find that writing in the morning works best for me. The mind is fresh and there are fewer distractions.=={{writing}}

{{writing}}==Free writing for 10 minutes before starting any structured writing helps clear mental blocks.=={{writing}}

{{workflow}}==Another aspect of my workflow is regular review and reflection. I check in weekly to see what's working and what needs adjustment.=={{workflow}}

## Using Square Brackets Format

[[ideas]]==Sometimes I get my best ideas while walking or doing routine tasks. The key is to capture them immediately before they slip away.

I keep a simple note-taking system that I can access from anywhere.==[[ideas]]

[[writing]]==The importance of character development in storytelling==[[writing]]

## With Optional Identifiers (for Obsidian Quadro)
